5. Select the base branch and compare it with your branch.
6. Add a title and description for the PR.
7. Click "Create Pull Request."

**Steps to Review a Pull Request:**
1. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the repository.
2. Select the PR you want to review.
3. Examine the changes and add comments or suggestions.
4. Approve the PR or request changes.
5. Once approved, merge the PR into the base branch.

### GitHub Actions:

**Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.**

GitHub Actions are a CI/CD service that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. You can create workflows that build, test, and deploy your code whenever thereâ€™s a push or pull request.

**Example CI/CD Pipeline:**
1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Add a YAML file for the workflow (e.g., `ci.yml`).

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

This workflow triggers on push and pull request events to the `main` branch, sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
